You can create an MCP server in two ways: **MCPay Build** (zero-setup) or the **[MCPay SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcpay)** (full control).

## MCPay SDK

For SDK, go to the [SDK page](/quickstart/sdk).

## MCPay Build

**MCPay Build** is a v0/Lovable-style flow to scaffold, preview, and monetize MCP servers—no boilerplate.

- **Describe** your tools in natural language.
- **Preview & test** them live while you iterate.
- **Inspect the code** that’s generated.

When you’re ready, **one-click deploy**: it creates a GitHub repo and deploys to Vercel.

### How it works (under the hood)

MCPay Build runs on an **MCP server** that manages everything via MCP tools, providing a **full remote development environment** (scaffolding, code edits, preview orchestration, pricing, and deploy).
