title: "Monetize"
description: "Two paths to price and protect your tools: no-code on the website or full-control with the SDK."
---

MCPay lets you add on-chain pricing to any MCP or OpenAPI server.

Whether you prefer to configure everything from the dashboard or define logic in code, both paths use the same x402 standard.

| Path | Best for | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **[Website](https://mcpay.tech/register)** | Fastest go-live, existing services | Configure prices per tool/route in the dashboard. |
| **[SDK](/quickstart/sdk)** | Custom logic & full control | Define **paid tools** in code, set pricing, and ship an MCP server that speaks x402 out of the box. |

## Website (No-code)

Use the **Monetize** flow to price tools with zero code changes to your upstream.

**Steps**:
1. Go to [mcpay.tech/register](https://mcpay.tech/register) and input your MCP or OpenAPI URL.
2. Pick the **tools/routes** you want to charge for.
3. Set **price** (e.g., `$0.05` per call), **asset** (e.g., USDC), and **chain** (e.g., Base).
4. **Publish**. Your server’s MCPay URL is now pay-protected.

**Great for**:
- Wrapping an existing API **without touching code** with pricing.
- Quickly charging for individiaul **MCP tools** or API routes into paid MCP tools.

## SDK (Code)

Choose the SDK when you want **code-level control**. Define free or paid tools, attach per-call pricing, and let the client transport **auto-handle x402 (pay → retry)** for MCP **and** plain HTTP services.

**Great for**:
- Full control over pricing & validation in code  
- Works with Next.js, Express, Workers, etc.
