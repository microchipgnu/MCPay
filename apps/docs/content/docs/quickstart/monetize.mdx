title: "Monetize"
description: "Two paths to price and protect your tools: no-code on the website or full-control with the SDK."

There are two ways to monetize an MCP server (or a plain HTTP API):

| Path | Best for | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Website (No-code)** | Fastest go-live, existing services | Configure prices per tool/route in the dashboard. The MCPay proxy returns `402` + price metadata and auto-retries after payment. |
| **SDK (Code)** | Custom logic & full control | Define **paid tools** in code, set pricing, and ship an MCP/HTTP server that speaks x402 out of the box. |

## Option A — Website (No-code)

Use the **Register/Monetize** flow to price tools with zero code changes to your upstream.

**Steps**
1. Go to **`https://mcpay.tech/register`** and register your MCP server (or an HTTP endpoint to wrap).
2. Pick the **tools/routes** you want to charge for.
3. Set **price** (e.g., `$0.05` per call), **asset** (e.g., USDC), and **chain** (e.g., Base).
4. (Optional) Configure memo/expiry and basic rate-limits.
5. **Publish**. Your server’s MCPay URL is now pay-protected.

**What happens under the hood**
- First unauthenticated call → **`402 Payment Required`** with `accepts { asset, amount, destination, memo, expiry }`.
- Client (or the MCPay transport) pays on-chain, then **the proxy retries the original request** and returns the real response.
- **Usage/revenue events** are emitted for your analytics.

**Great for**
- Wrapping an existing API **without touching code**.
- Quickly turning individual **MCP tools** into paid endpoints.
- Letting **agents and browsers** pay per call with the same flow.

## Option B — SDK (Code)

Choose the SDK when you want **code-level control**. Define free or paid tools, attach per-call pricing, and let the client transport **auto-handle `402`/x402 (pay → retry)** for MCP **and** plain HTTP services. Ideal for versioned codebases, testing, and CI/CD.

- Full control over pricing & validation in code  
- Works with Next.js, Express, Workers, etc.
