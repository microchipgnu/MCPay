---

## General

**What is MCPay?**  
MCPay is a **payment layer for MCP and HTTP servers**. It implements the [x402 protocol](https://x402.org), which lets any client (human app or AI agent) call a tool, get payment requirements with price metadata, pay on-chain, and retry automatically.

**Do I have to use MCP?**  
Yes.

**Who is MCPay for?**  
- **Providers** who want to **monetize per-call access** to their APIs/tools.  
- **Agents/Integrators** who need **programmatic, per-request payments** without API keys or subscriptions.  
- **Builders** who want the **fastest path** to ship a paid MCP server.

**What’s the MCPay Registry?**  
A public catalog of MCP servers and their priced tools. It shows metadata, usage stats, and integration snippets. Browse at [Servers](/servers).

**What is MCPay Build?**  
A builder tool that lets you **define tools, preview them live, set prices, and one-click deploy** to GitHub + Vercel. Under the hood it runs on an MCP server.  
- Builder UI: [mcpay.tech/build](https://mcpay.tech/build)  
- Example Build server: [mcpay.tech/servers/23e2ab26-7808-4984-855c-ec6a7dc97c3a](https://mcpay.tech/servers/23e2ab26-7808-4984-855c-ec6a7dc97c3a)

## How it works

**What is x402 and the 402 flow?**  
1. Client calls a protected route/tool.  
2. Service responds with `402` and metadata (`asset, amount, destination, memo, expiry`).  
3. Client (or MCPay proxy/SDK) **pays on-chain**.  
4. Request is retried with payment proof.  
5. Response succeeds.  

**Is this “Stripe for agents”?**  
It has a similar goal — enabling monetization — but different mechanics: no API keys, no subscriptions, no dashboards. It’s **pay-per-call at protocol level**, natively understood by agents.

**Can humans also pay?**  
Yes. If the request comes from a browser, wallet extensions or embedded wallets can complete the same 402 payment flow.

## Pricing & Business

**What pricing models are supported?**  
- **Flat per call** (default).  
- **Tiered or per-tool** pricing.  
- **Dynamic pricing** <span style={{

    border: "1px solid #ff9800"
}}>coming soon</span>

**Does MCPay take a cut?**  
No by default — payments are routed **directly to your wallet**. If you use managed wallets or optional hosted features, platform fees may apply.

**Do you support revenue splits?**  
Splits can be implemented by emitting multiple accepted destinations in 402 metadata, or handled off-chain. Native splits are on the roadmap. <span style={{

## Payments, Wallets & Chains

import { SupportedEVMNetworks,  SupportedSVMNetworks } from "x402/types";

**Which chains/tokens are supported?**  

Stablecoins (like **USDC**) on all supported networks.  

Currently supported EVM networks: {SupportedEVMNetworks.map((network, i) => (<span key={network}>{network}{i !== SupportedEVMNetworks.length - 1 ? ', ' : ''}</span>))}

Solana and other SVM networks: {SupportedSVMNetworks.map((network, i) => (<span key={network}>{network}{i !== SupportedSVMNetworks.length - 1 ? ', ' : ''}</span>))}

**What wallets can be used?**  
- **EOAs** via private key (for dev/test).  
- **CDP/embedded wallets** (better UX).  
- **Browser wallets** for humans.  

**How do I cap spend?**  
Set `maxPaymentValue` in the SDK (denominated in base units, e.g. 6 decimals for USDC). This ensures per-call spend cannot exceed a limit.

---

## Security & Reliability

**Do you store private keys?**  
- In SDK mode, keys remain on your server/client.  
- With managed wallets, keys stay with the wallet provider; MCPay only verifies proofs.

**Rate limits & DoS?**  
The proxy includes **basic rate limiting**, header scrubbing, and GET caching. Standard API security (WAF, throttling) is still recommended.

---

## SDK, CLI & DevEx

**Which languages are supported?**  
Official **TypeScript SDK + CLI**. Any language can integrate by handling `402` and sending back an `X-PAYMENT` proof.

**How do I integrate quickly?**  
With the CLI:  

```bash
npx mcpay server --urls https://mcpay.tech/mcp/<id> --private-key 0xYOUR_KEY
```

**How do I define paid tools in code?**

Check the SDK [here](/quickstart/sdk)

```ts
import { createMcpPaidHandler } from "mcpay/handler"

export const paidMcp = createMcpPaidHandler(
  async (server) => {
    server.paidTool(
      "hello",
      "say hello",
      "$0.001",
      {},
      async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello, world!" }] })
    )
  },
  {
    recipient: { evm: { address: "0xYOUR_ADDRESS" } }
  }
)

```

## Legal

**Are you affiliated with the APIs I wrap?**

No. MCPay is an integration layer. Wrapped APIs remain independent and subject to their own terms.
