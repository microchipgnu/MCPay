**Endpoint:** `https://facilitator.mcpay.tech`

A high-availability passthrough proxy for [x402 facilitators](https://x402.org). It provides a single stable entrypoint with failover, retries, and load balancing across multiple upstream facilitators.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Passthrough Proxy**: Transparently forwards requests to upstream x402 facilitators.  
- **On-Demand Health Checks**: Lightweight, stateless monitoring of facilitator health.  
- **Automatic Failover**: Routes around failures by switching to healthy facilitators.  
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient network or service errors.  
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic randomly among available healthy targets.  
- **Monitoring Endpoints**: Health (`/health`) and status (`/status`) endpoints for observability.  
- **Edge & Serverless Ready**: Stateless by design, no background processes required.  

## ðŸ”— Upstream Targets

The proxy currently balances across:  

- [`https://facilitator.x402.rs`](https://facilitator.x402.rs)  
- [`https://facilitator.payai.network`](https://facilitator.payai.network)  

Additional facilitators (Coinbase, thirdweb, bankr, meridian, ABK LABS, mogami) can be added as they publish stable endpoints.

Your requests will automatically be routed through healthy upstream facilitators.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

* `GET /health` â†’ quick health check (200 if proxy is up)
* `GET /status` â†’ JSON report of upstream health and routing state
