# Examples

This directory contains small, self-contained examples demonstrating how to use MCPay components and services.

- Each subfolder is its own package (added to pnpm-workspace) so you can `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` within it.
- Keep examples minimal and focused on one concept.

Suggested structure:

- `minimal-mcp-client/` – Small client example that calls MCP via `mcpay` SDK
- `facilitator-proxy/` – Sample deployment of the facilitator proxy config
- `docs-snippets/` – Code used in the docs site
